=== Echoes of Eden ===

It was a world marred by the scars of industrial greed, where the remnants of once-thriving cities lay in ruins beneath a polluted sky. Amidst the wreckage, a lone figure emerged, her silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of decay.

Ava, a former environmental scientist turned eco-warrior, surveyed the desolation before her with a heavy heart. The air was thick with the stench of pollution, a constant reminder of humanity's disregard for the planet.

With a determined resolve, Ava set out on her mission, her footsteps echoing through the silence of the wasteland. She knew the path ahead would be fraught with danger, but she refused to back down in the face of adversity.

As Ava ventured deeper into the heart of darkness, the echoes of Eden whispered through the ruins, guiding her towards her ultimate goal. She was the last hope for a world on the brink of destruction, a beacon of light amidst the encroaching shadows.

In this world of chaos and despair, Ava was a symbol of defiance, a warrior fighting for the future of humanity and the planet itself. With every step she took, she vowed to do whatever it took to bring about change and restore balance to the world.

As the sun began to set on the horizon, casting a fiery glow across the landscape, Ava stood firm in her resolve. The battle ahead would be long and arduous, but she was ready to face whatever challenges lay in her path.

The stage was set, the pieces in motion. In the darkness of the night, a new chapter in the struggle for survival was about to begin.

=== Scene: Ava's Dilemma ===

Ava crouched behind a row of gleaming steel tanks in the dimly lit laboratory, her heart pounding in her chest as she listened to the chilling conversation unfolding before her.

Two men, clad in expensive suits and exuding an aura of power, stood before a holographic display, discussing Ava's latest invention with a callous disregard for its potential consequences.

"We'll use this technology to cripple their economies," one of the men declared, his voice dripping with greed. "Once they're desperate enough, they'll have no choice but to sign over their resources to us."

A cold shiver ran down Ava's spine as she realized the true intentions behind her work. They weren't interested in saving the planet; they were intent on exploiting it for their own gain, no matter the cost.

Fear and disbelief gripped Ava's heart as she grappled with the enormity of the situation. She had to stop them, but how? The weight of responsibility bore down on her, threatening to crush her spirit beneath its relentless burden.

With trembling hands, Ava made her decision. She had to destroy the evidence of her research before it fell into the wrong hands. But as she reached for the stack of papers on her desk, a thought flickered in her mind—a USB stick hidden in her drawer, containing the key to her invention.

Option 1: Destroy the Research
-> "Destroy them all."
Ava's fingers trembled as she shredded the papers into a whirlwind of confetti, her heart heavy with regret. But before she could finish, the laboratory door burst open, and her manager strode in, his expression a mask of fury.

"You fool!" he spat, his eyes ablaze with anger. "What have you done?"

Ava's blood ran cold as she realized the magnitude of her mistake. With a sinking feeling in her stomach, she knew she had to escape—and fast.
->END

Option 2: Retrieve the USB Stick
-> "Grab the USB stick."
Ava's hand darted to the drawer, fingers fumbling in desperation as she grasped the small device hidden within. With a sense of urgency, she pocketed the USB stick and turned to leave.

But as she stepped into the corridor, her manager rounded the corner, his gaze falling upon her with suspicion. Panic surged through Ava's veins as she realized she had been caught red-handed.

Option 1 Consequence: Ava Grabs a Gun
-> "Grab the gun from the security guard."
With adrenaline coursing through her veins, Ava lunged towards the nearest security guard, wresting the gun from his holster with a desperate strength she didn't know she possessed. With a final glance at her manager's horrified expression, she bolted from the laboratory, leaving chaos in her wake.

Option 2 Consequence: Ava is Caught
-> "Escape from the building by shooting the security guards."
As security guards closed in around her, Ava's hand tightened around the USB stick in her pocket. With no other option left, she raised the stolen gun and fired, the deafening sound echoing through the corridors as she fought her way to freedom.

=== Scene: Ava's Escape ===

The corridor stretches out before Ava, a maze of steel and shadows as she races towards freedom. Behind her, the sound of approaching footsteps grows louder, the guards closing in with each passing second.

Ava's heart pounds in her chest as she clutches the stolen gun, her fingers trembling with adrenaline-fueled anticipation. She knows what she must do to survive, even if it means crossing a line she never thought she would.

Choice:

* "Fight your way through." -> FightThrough
* "Try to evade them." -> EvadeThem

=== FightThrough ===

With a steely resolve, Ava raises the gun and takes aim at the approaching guards. The world slows to a crawl as she squeezes the trigger, each shot ringing out like thunder in the narrow confines of the corridor.


-> [AvaShoots] 

=== AvaShoots ===

The guards stagger back, their cries of pain echoing off the walls as Ava's bullets find their mark. She moves with precision and determination, her every movement calculated as she fights her way through the opposition.

But with each life she takes, a heavy weight settles in Ava's chest—a reminder of the cost of her actions, and the line she has crossed in her desperate bid for freedom.

-> [Continue]

=== EvadeThem ===

Ducking into a side corridor, Ava presses herself against the cold metal wall, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. She knows she can't fight her way out of this, not without risking even more lives in the process.

With a silent prayer, Ava creeps forward, her footsteps barely making a sound as she tries to slip past the guards unnoticed. Every shadow is a potential hiding place, every creak of metal a potential alarm.


    -> [AvaEvaids] 

=== AvaEvaids ===

Time seems to stretch on forever as Ava inches her way through the labyrinth of corridors, her heart pounding in her ears with every step. But just as she dares to hope for escape, a pair of eyes meet hers from the darkness ahead.

With a sinking feeling in her stomach, Ava realizes she's been caught. There's nowhere left to run, and the consequences of her actions weigh heavy on her soul.

-> END

=== Scene: Ava's Dilemma Continues ===

Ava's apartment is cloaked in shadows as she hurriedly gathers her belongings—a passport, ID, and a handful of cash. Fear gnaws at her insides, twisting her stomach into knots as she glances nervously at the USB stick lying on her computer desk.

The research document on her screen taunts her with its potential—knowledge that could either save or doom the planet, depending on who wields it. Ava's mind races with indecision, torn between the desire to protect her work and the need to stop those who would abuse it for their own gain.

Just as panic threatens to consume her, a spark of clarity cuts through the chaos. She knows what she must do. She must find Dr. Reynolds, her mentor and confidant, the one person she trusts to help her navigate this treacherous path.

->END

    -> [AvaDecides]

=== AvaDecides ===

With a determined resolve, Ava makes her choice. She slips into a disguise, masking her identity beneath layers of fabric and shadow, and prepares to face the dangers that lie in wait outside her door.

Choice:

* "Leave disguised." -> LeaveDisguised
* "Escape through the emergency exit." -> EscapeEmergencyExit

=== LeaveDisguised ===

Ava cautiously makes her way down the stairs, her heart pounding in her chest with each step. As she reaches the ground floor, she catches sight of the men in black suits lurking beneath her apartment building, their ominous presence a chilling reminder of the danger she faces.

Without hesitation, Ava raises her gun and takes aim, her hands steady despite the fear coursing through her veins. With a series of precise shots, she fends off her pursuers, determined to reach Dr. Reynolds at any cost.

Ink:

    -> [AvaEscapesDisguised]

=== AvaEscapesDisguised ===

With the men in black defeated, Ava slips into the shadows, her disguise providing a fleeting sense of safety as she disappears into the night. But even as she flees, she knows that the true battle has only just begun.

-> END

=== EscapeEmergencyExit ===

Ava throws open the emergency exit door and races out into the night, the cold wind biting at her skin as she flees from her pursuers. The men in black are hot on her heels, their footsteps echoing through the deserted streets as they give chase.

With every passing moment, Ava's breath comes harder, her muscles burning with exertion as she pushes herself to the limit. But she knows she can't afford to slow down, not when her life—and the fate of the world—hangs in the balance.

    -> [AvaChasedDownStreet]

=== AvaChasedDownStreet ===

The streets blur past in a dizzying whirl as Ava races through the city, her heart pounding in her chest with every step. But no matter how fast she runs, the men in black are always one step behind, their relentless pursuit closing in from all sides.

With nowhere left to turn, Ava's options dwindle with each passing moment. But even in the face of overwhelming odds, she refuses to give up hope. Driven by a fierce determination, she presses forward, her eyes fixed on the horizon as she races towards an uncertain future.
